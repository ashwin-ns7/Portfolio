# Portfolio
This is a portfolio webpage developed by a mechatronics engineer who is interested in information technology and software engineering, and artificial intelligence. 
The webpage showcases some of the projects and skills that I have acquired in these fields, which is the integration of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering. 
The webpage includes a brief introduction about myself, a list of my education and work experience, a gallery of my projects with descriptions and links to the source code, and a contact form for anyone 
who wants to get in touch with me. The webpage is responsive and designed with HTML, CSS. I hope you enjoy browsing through my portfolio and learning more about me and my work.
